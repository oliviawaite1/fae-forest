So far, I still need to collect my base audio I want to use to create the sounds of the forest. I'll be collecting it in the park at night this week. Currently, I have collected some sounds I want to layer into the forest to create the sense of liminality or dissociation from reality within the forest. I currently have 6 sounds to edit and work with, and I have done minor editing on two (dinner party and laugh 2).
